It can use a directory ( by default public_html ) and make all the files and folders inside visible to web client requests.<br>&nbsp;<br>For the classic "hello world" example , we could go and replace the index.html file content with &lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt; and thats it.<br>All the incoming requests would&nbsp; get served with the hello world page just as expected..<br><br><br>

<big style="background-color: white; color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><big><span style="font-style: italic;">Writing a More Dynamic Service</span></big></big><br>Stepping up the difficulty curve , lets say we want to write a dynamic hello world message which will count the times it got viewed and output them on each client request. <br>You can review the <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/AmmarServer/blob/master/doc/helloworld.c">helloworld example here</a> , most of the lines are comments and as you will soon figure out , what we do is create a virtual file called "index.html" and redirect all requests to it to a callback function called prepare_helloworld_content_callback. When prepare_helloworld_content_callback is executed it fills helloworld.content with a webpage and then returns. The webserver serves this result back to the client and the process continues..!<br><br>We can also query GET and POST variables rather like the PHP $_GET[] , $_POST[] and $_FILE[] arrays by using the provided functions&nbsp; AmmServer_GETArg and AmmServer_POSTArg , please note that the naming conventions will change to become more practical as the project matures and this will have to happen soon in order to prevent breaking services due to interfacing changes.. $_GET["user"] is much prettier than AmmServer_GETArg(form,"user",val,256) I know.. :P<br><br>TODO : Gradually as more functionality will get implemented more examples and information will be added here.. !<br>For further questions and bug reports fill free to use the <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/AmmarServer/issues?state=open">issues</a> system..<br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;
