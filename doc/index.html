But beeing big and complex means requiring  a very large deployment payload and using PHP ( or any other interpreted language ) with it is a heavy task for the host computer especially when this computer doesnt have many computing resources. The picture gets even worse when services like Wordpress which have&nbsp; thousands lines of code generate dynamic content .. The delays sum up and this leads to a very bad user experience while accessing and browsing the site..<br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div>
