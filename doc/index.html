But all these positive qualities also mean that it is big and it is complex requiring  a realatively large deployment and configuration payload ( for a LAMP installation ).<br><br>Using PHP ( or any other interpreted high-level language ) felt right at home , with is C-like language structure and goodies like multi line strings and loose variable declaration rules .&nbsp; But it proved a&nbsp; a heavy task for computer hosts lacking many computing resources or serving a very large number of requests. The picture gets even worse when services like Wordpress which have&nbsp; thousands lines of code generate dynamic content .. The delays sum up and this leads to a very bad user experience while accessing and browsing the site.. Of course I am not the only one that has observed this and there are many projects to improve the situation and combat performance overheads such as&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_for_PHP">the Hip-Hop library</a> developed by facebook that translated php to a C++ generating a compiled binary and reduced their loads by a respectable 50%..<br><br>All this is good but is it the best we can do ? <br>No , the least overhead possible can only be achieved by closely coupling the webserver with the dynamic content it serves.. Compiled php binaries do the same but&nbsp; instead of having seperate "entities" the architecture of AmmarServer statically links the webserver library with the dynamic content which is compiled into the same executable..<br><br>For a sample application you can <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/V4L2ToHTTP/blob/master/src/main.cpp">see my V4L2ToHTTP project</a> that receives frames from a video device ( i.e. webcam ) encodes them into jpeg format in memory , and when a client requests a version of cam.jpg the callback dynamically uploads the new frame with minimal internal "communication" overhead since the frame is mmaped to the place where the kernel receives the usb data , it then uses libjpeg for a hardware optimized conversion and then just basically moves a pointer address which is utilized by the send socket command to send the frame..<br>The datapath literally can't get any smaller..<br><br>TODO : More Info<br>TODO : Deployment&nbsp; <br>TODO : AmmarServer as a potential&nbsp; <a href="http://www.allegrosoft.com/rpproduct.html">RomPager</a> opensource alternative <br>TODO : <br><br>AmmarServer is relatively stable , but not thoroughly tested ( security , pentesting etc ) <br><br>Todo..<br>  </td></tr></tbody></table><br></div>
