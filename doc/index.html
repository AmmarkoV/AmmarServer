<big style="background-color: white; color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><big><span style="font-style: italic;">Its History</span></big></big><br>AmmarServer began as a small sockets project back on 2004 , its main
use back then was serving as a portable executable that I could take with me to share static files
between different machines&nbsp; without having administrator privilages , setting up shares , on
different Operating Systems and network topologies..&nbsp;  <br><br>Needless to
say despite beeing "my own brainchild" , it wasn`t a webserver particularly
useful on anything but static content and I always used Apache , MySQL
and PHP as infrastructure for serious web-development work which served
me well .. until I started working on embedded systems..<br><br>The
Apache web server is a wonderful piece of software with a very large
collection of plugins and modules and a huge percentage of the internet
gets served by it every day, it is robust , mature , well documented
and it is secure.. But all these positive qualities also mean that it
is big and it is complex requiring a relatively large deployment and
configuration payload ( for a LAMP installation ).<br><br>Using PHP (
or any other interpreted high-level language ) felt right at home from
the first time I used it. With its C-like language structure but more
goodies like multi line strings and loose variable declaration rules .&nbsp;
It proved to be an invaluable tool but gradually also proved a heavy
task for computer hosts lacking many computing resources or serving a
very large number of requests. The picture got even worse when
services like Wordpress ( which is also great ) that have many thousands lines of code generate
dynamic content..&nbsp; The delays , wether they where Disk , CPU or Memory
based summed up and this lead to a very bad user experience while
accessing and browsing various site configurations. Of course I am not
the only one that has observed this and there are many projects to
improve the situation and combat performance overheads such as&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HipHop_for_PHP">the Hip-Hop library</a>
developed by facebook that translated php to a C++ generating a
compiled binary and reduced their loads by a respectable 50%.. Other
"home-made" solutions I tried was operating on memfs or ramfs
partitions and many other hacks which optimized things more and more..<br><br>At some point I thought..<br>All this is good but is it the best that can be done ? <br>What would be the best way to do it ?<br>The least overhead possible can only be achieved by closely coupling
the webserver with the dynamic content it serves. Compiled php
binaries offer a faster way to generate the content&nbsp; but this content is loosely tied with the server that actually sends it. <br>Instead of having seperate "entities" for the webserver&nbsp; the
architecture of AmmarServer statically links the webserver library with
the dynamic content which is compiled into the same executable..&nbsp; <br><br>

<big style="background-color: white; color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><big><span style="font-style: italic;">What is it ?</span></big></big><br>AmmarServer is a low level framework that allows the creation of binary executables which contain both their webserver and the ability to generate dynamic pages.<br><br>A sample application that demonstrates this concept and you can see , <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/V4L2ToHTTP/blob/master/src/main.cpp">is my V4L2ToHTTP project</a>
that uses AmmarServer as its backbone. V4L2ToHTTP is aimed at a thin server that receives frames from a video device
( i.e. webcam ) encodes them into jpeg format in memory , and when a
client requests a version of cam.jpg the callback dynamically snaps and uploads a new frame from the camera. The whole point of course is having the minimal possible internal "generation/communication" overhead and the
lowest possible memory footprint since the frame is mmaped to the place
where the kernel receives the USB camera frame data , it then uses libjpeg for a
hardware optimized conversion and then just basically moves a pointer
address which is utilized by the send socket command to send the frame. The datapath literally can't get any smaller..<br><br>The way to write a web-service using AmmarServer is somewhat different than writing a PHP webservice on Apache. <br>Each service is a different executable ( process ) that binds a TCP/IP port , instead of a collection of scripts.&nbsp; In order to serve clients each service spawns its own maximum number of threads ( and can get individually balanced by the kernel scheduler ) instead of preforking seperate processes like Apache does. <a href="https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/#WhyPthreads">AmmarServer works with threads ( see why )</a> in order to use a lower overall amount of memory , and to make it easier for the programmer ( and the Kernel process scheduler ) to prioritize serving requests on tight budgets. WebHosting services like godaddy etc.. are not fit to use this model since every&nbsp; "page" would have to be a seperate&nbsp; "server" .. So this server doesnot target this deployment scenario but rather the "dedicated hosting"&nbsp; one..<br>It is not really meant for a server that hosts 1000 different PHP services&nbsp; ( although I guess it could also be used that way ;P ) but for a Facebook or Youtube like project when we want a few number of services like uploading&nbsp; , caching and serving content , browsing pictures , editing profile information etc in order to make each of these sub tasks  a different "server" as efficient as possible while maintaining a conceptually simple and maintainable model for the developer.  <br><br><br>

Please <a href="howto.html">click here to read a small intro and howto on writing your first AmmarServer service</a>..<br>Coding style helpers are kind of a stub for now , since there are key parts of the library that are missing , and providing easier calls , aliases etc for missing functionality is impossible , it is something that should really happen in the future..<br>What I basically want to say is that the Model-&gt;View abstractions of Rails , or other modeling techniques are a nice thing , and there isn't any relevant helper functions built in the framework&nbsp; , or even a coding template so unfortunately I can't tell you how to organize your content for now.. <br>I would guess that AmmarServer would naturaly mix well with <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/ecpg.html">ECPG</a>&nbsp; (PostgreSQL embedded for C ) and that the state information could be kept there if you want to use SQL. Most of the visual things ( CSS , images , videos , audio ,&nbsp; JScripts )&nbsp; should be in static files&nbsp;&nbsp; , and that the callbacks for conent shouldn't be thousands lines of code but instead use external functions that fit the model of the problem you are trying to solve..  <br><br><br><big style="background-color: white; color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><big><span style="font-style: italic;">Future Planned Projects using AmmarServer </span></big></big><br>- An opensource <a target="_blank" href="http://www.allegrosoft.com/rpproduct.html">RomPager</a> alternative or <a href="http://www.webmin.com/" target="_blank">Webmin</a> alternative <br>- A more efficient version of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MasterEx/myloader">myloader</a><br>- Replacing Apache as the Web Interface of <a href="http://ammar.gr/gddg">GuarddoG robot</a><br>- Making a Video Surveillance daemon like <a href="http://www.zoneminder.com/">zoneminder</a> with emphasis on performance and small system footprint<br>- Replacing my WebServer ( for <a href="http://ammar.gr" target="_blank">http://ammar.gr</a> ) with a Rasberry pi running AmmarServer<br><br><br>
