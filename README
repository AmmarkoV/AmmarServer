One of the most basic philosophies behind this is to try to add as much functionality possible in a reusable way *WITHOUT* overly increasing loc and dependencies.. The biggest recent improvements have been actually trying to merge common functionality and reducing loc. 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The projects build dependencies are the gcc compiler , pthreads , cmake and pretty basic things 
so if you issue sudo apt-get install build-essential  ( assuming a Debian/Ubuntu based system ) you should be able to compile it without problems..

Newer versions also support compression , so you might want to also apt-get install liblzma-dev if you enable ENABLE_COMPRESSION at server_configuration.h
MyURL needs libjpeg in order to serve captchas , so to add it sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

To perform a compilation you just need to issue 
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake ..
make

This should try to compile all of the project files which you can then run using the scripts listed in the list below 

To update your version of the project you can use the provided script that updates directly from github
It will remove any changes you have made to any of the files in the repository   
./update_from_git from the root directory
