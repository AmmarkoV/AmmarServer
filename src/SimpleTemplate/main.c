/*! Dynamic content code ..! START!*/
/* A few words about dynamic content here..
   This is actually one of the key features on AmmarServer and maybe the reason that I started the whole project
   What I am trying to do here is serve content by directly linking the webserver to binary ( NOT Interpreted ) code
   in order to serve pages with the maximum possible efficiency and skipping all intermediate layers..

   PHP , Ruby , Python and all other "web-languages" are very nice and handy and to be honest I can do most of my work fine using PHP , MySQL and Apache
   However setting up , configuring and maintaining large projects with different database systems , separate configuration files for each of the sub parts
   and re deploying everything is a very tiresome affair.. Not to mention that despite the great work done by the apache  , PHP etc teams performance is wasted
   due to the interpreters of the various scripting languages used..

   Things can't get any faster than AmmarServer and the whole programming interface exposed to the programmer is ( imho ) very friendly and familiar to even inexperienced
   C developer..

   What follows is the decleration of some "Dynamic Content Resources" their Constructors/Destructors and their callback routines that fill them with the content to be served
   each time a client requests one of the pages..

  //No range check but since everything here is static max_stats_size should be big enough not to segfault with the strcat calls!
