<p>I am pleased to report that using NVidia driver 304.22 along with a 3.2.0-28 kernel and powermizer set to the lowest level ( always ) is stable and I can now once again play starcraft 2 using wine without my pc getting a blank screen every 10 minutes ..! </p>
<p>My /etc/X11/xorg.conf Screen section follows..!</p>

<p>In other news since it is summer and I dont have many things to do..<br>
I decided to rewrite from scratch AmmarServer ( http server ) for linux ..<br>
The <a href="~ammar/atech_old/Myshop/view_item.php@id=4.html">outdated windows version of AmmarServer can be found in my legacy site</a> ..<br>
In this new one I will be including keep-alive support , a better code layout , the ability to create virtual files via linking an arbitrary executable to the web server , and automatic caching web page queries to the memory.. This should be particularly handy to be used as a server in conjuction with the raspberry pi.. ( when I get my hands on one ) ..</p>
<p>The thing about virtual files is that I would like to make a virtual file called camera.jpg that when requested by the client would trigger an other frame grabbing application that would make a .jpg conversion of the image on the fly and serve it directly to the client without reading or writing to the flash memory/disk .. That way linking everything together all possible delays will be shoved off..!</p>

AmmarServer github repository can be found here</a></p>
<p>Thats it for now..</p>
