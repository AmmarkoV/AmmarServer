<p>I bought a mobile phone before entering military service so that I can surf the web while on the move..! The phone I bought is marketed in Greece as “Vodafone joy 845″ and in reality it is made by a Chineese company called <a href="http://www.huawei.com/">HUAWEI</a> .  It was the cheapest smartphone available priced at only 109 euros and it is really worth its money..! <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">  I knew that this company made DSLAM modems for the Greek National Phone Company ( <a href="http://www.ote.gr">OTE</a> ) so the quality of the fabrication would be good enough so that it would last at least the 9 months at the military..<br>
Not only does it work flawlessly for the third month ( at the time of writing ) but in fact I am so pleased by it , that it deserves to be mentioned here in my blog..! <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
<p>Among the cool things you can do with it ( using the correct software , of course you can do them with any android enabled phone )  is<br>
* Use it as a Wifi access point/gateway that enables any wifi enabled pc/device to connect to the internet through GPRS/HDSPA<br>
* Use it as an IP Camera ( Wifi IP <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  )<br>
* Use it as a GPS Navigator / Compass / GPS Beacon over Internet ( i.e. Google Latitude  )<br>
* Use it as a Skype phone</p>
<p>and as a PDF Reader  / Wifi Scanner / Compass / Calender / SSH Client / IRC Client / WebBrowser / Youtube Viewer / Camera / Mp3 Player / Voice Recorder and much more..!</p>
<p>Google has done an excelent job with the User Interface , the android market and all of the apps are either free and opensource or ad-ware ( mostly games )<br>
There are some privacy concerns regarding the ads , but what the hell.. ;P</p>
