 <p>As I’ve mentioned before , one of the original goals of 
AmmarServer was getting rid of my current web server and replacing it 
with a Raspberry Pi. As one can easily notice this site is based on 
wordpress ( one thing that is a little harder to notice is that it is 
hosted in a PC in my kitchen <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  ) .  WordPress is a heavy burden even on my current Intel Based machine let alone on the slower Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>There are tools that cache the wordpress web pages or imporve PHP 
performance but basically all of them try to work around quering the 
database and PHP interpreter  and serving static files instead.. </p>
<p>To add to the CPU limitations of the Pi , using an SD card also means delays when writing/and reading to disk ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory#Memory_wear">not to mention the finite read/write cycles</a>
 ) when performing automatic caching operations , so instead of this I 
decided to add a script ( basically an alias for a wget call with the 
needed parameters ) that clones the whole site without hassle..   </p>
<p>If you want to try it and after cloning AmmarServer ( with “git clone
 git://github.com/AmmarkoV/AmmarServer ” ) you can use the bash script 
provided in the repository and called “MirrorAmmarServer.sh”<br>
Lets say that your WordPress blog is hosted on http://ammar.gr .<br>
STEP 1 ) Being on the parent directory of AmmarServer  issue “./MirrorAmmarServer.sh http://ammar.gr”<br>
wget will gradually start to mirror the site into static files and 
create a subdirectory called ammar.gr/ where the files will be stored<br>
STEP 2 ) Edit the file src/main.c and change  char 
webserver_root[MAX_FILE_PATH]=”public_html/”; to char 
webserver_root[MAX_FILE_PATH]=”ammar.gr/”;<br>
If you want you can change the DEFAULT_BINDING_PORT to another port ( 
you may want to set it to port 80 because the default is 8080 )<br>
STEP 3 ) issue “./make &amp;&amp; ./run_ammarserver” and voila your site
 will be availiable at http://127.0.0.1:8080 ( or any other port you 
choose )</p>
<p>Here is a comparison of pinging the Raspberry Pi and pinging my Intel Based Server PC on a LAN<br>
<a href="+++WEBROOT+++wp-content/uploads/2012/10/raspberry_pi_vs_intel_ping_times.png"><img src="+++RESOURCES+++/raspberry_pi_vs_intel_ping_times-300x98.png" alt="" title="raspberry_pi_vs_intel_ping_times" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-567" height="98" width="300"></a><br>
The ping times of the intel system have an average of 0.158 ms while the
 raspberry pi has an average time of 0.543 ms , almost 3-4 times worse..
 </p>
<p>Here are some benchmarks conducted with chromium that give an 
overview of the performance difference ( all of the tests are done in a 
LAN so bandwidth is not a limiting factor ) : </p>

<p>Some things to notice is that in the static files version of the site
 , the image links on the menu bar that come directly from github , and 
the youtube embeds are the most laggy parts of the page and this 
distorts loading times. The onload event would drop by almost 400ms if 
they were part of the site.. </p>
<p>Performance also gets better by increasing the priority of the webserver  ( IRL decreasing it to -15 <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">
  ) , removing cross-site content and making some other small tweaks. I 
have managed to drop times to around 50-60ms and I hope to further 
improve those numbers..</p>
<p>Network latency of course is the biggest bottleneck when dropping 
times so low and in any case even if i managed to serve the whole site 
from 60ms ( transaction latency ) + 150ms ( network latency )  in say 
20ms  ( transaction latency )  + 150 ms ( network latency ) the 
perceived difference from the average client will be very small..</p>
<p>Thats it for now.. <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">  </p>
