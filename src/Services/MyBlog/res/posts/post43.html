 <p>My very own Raspberry Pi just arrived today.. It took almost 10 days to come , but I got the updated 512MB RAM model so , <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/everything-went-better-than-expected">everything went better than expected</a>.. <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley">  .. Now I can finally return the one that I borrowed ( the second one I borrowed <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  anyways.. ) ..</p>

<p>Today I spent a good part of the day migrating my stuff to the Raspberry..<br>
The SD card I have installed has a total size 4GB so unfortunately not all of my things could fit..!<br>
Also I am very concerned about the memory wear problem so I am thinking 
of adding a USB hard drive and mounting all of the most active parts of 
the SD filesystem there ( /var /tmp /home/user/public_html etc.. )</p>
<p>The server that I plan to replace is this ( first time posing for the camera.. )<br>

<p>Its a cabling mess really <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">  with a case made out of the retail motherboard box..</p>
<p>The raspberry takes much less space and will draw much much less power making this site more eco-friendly <img src="+++RESOURCES+++/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">  .. My UPS will also be able to power it up for days in the event of a power failure ..</p>
<p>I also conducted some experiments with wordpress on the raspberry , 
it performs worse than my current machine but my upload bandwidth is 
such a big bottleneck that 300ms of delay are barely noticeable ( I 
tested it from the computers of some of my friends and sometimes it 
takes almost 20 seconds for it to completely load ) ..</p>
