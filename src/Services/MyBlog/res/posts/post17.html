<p>In the last days I resurrected one of my older projects ( A project started at 2010 <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  )  , FlashySlideshows..!</p>
<p>It is an album/slideshow/picture viewer based on OpenGL..<br>
While there are picture viewers that can perform slideshows , I don’t think there is any other Linux program available at this time that has this kind of functionality ( zoom , ken burns effects , face detection , joystick input etc.) so when I will finish with it I believe that many people will find it useful.  </p>
<p>There are many core features missing but it “works” and you can <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/FlashySlideshows/zipball/master">download it from here</a><br>
I am planning to add a lot of things in the near future such as a plugin system for many different effects , particles and reflections , loadable shaders for “picture effects” , background music playlists and more..<br>
I guess that it could even be used on presentations by exporting a presentation in PNG  format ( libre office can do that ) and then using FlashySlideshows as the renderer..</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/FlashySlideshows">This</a> is the source code repository </p>
<p>I have included some scripts that automate the installation/compilation/etc<br>
./apt-get-dependencies , apt-gets the libraries that are needed for compilation..<br>
./make  , compiles the project<br>
./FlashySlideShowStarterApp , opens the GUI for picking a directory and starting the viewer<br>
./install.sh , installs it into the system<br>
./uninstall.sh , uninstalls it! <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"> </p>

<p>A similar program is the picture sideshow program on the PS3 , though it has an awful framerate and limited effects ( and I don’t like the PS3 <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  ) so I am making one for my PC..  <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley"> </p>
