<p>After using up Cheetah , Puma , Jaguar , Panther, Tiger ,Leopard , Snow Leopard and Lion and having reached the king of the jungle ( the lion ) the MacOS marketing team has recently run out of cool animals for their Operating System. </p>
<p>Since an Operating System without a big number and a cool and fearsome animal will be a commercial catastrophe , especially for the trendy target group of Mac users and to prevent sales from flopping , a new line up of mythical/extinct animals ranging from dinosaurs and dragons to the flying spaghetti monster and the yeti is scheduled for usage from the next version forward.</p>

After starting the incrementations of the major version number on their browsers , and again for retarded reasons such as marketing (a known law in computer science [besides Turing's , Moore's and Murphy's laws] is that code quality can be directly computed by the source code version number) the next step is using complex numbers like Chrome 18+5i , scientific notation like 133.141600E+000 and Roman numerals such as MCMXC</p>
