<p>Today I purchased a T-Adapter made from bresser along with a Nikon adapter for my telescope ( MEADE DS-2102MAK )</p>
<p>The T-Adapter was orignaly meant for the ETX-90/125 but fitted just fine and after some focusing it allowed the camera to produce magnificent quality pictures.. Unfortunately I ran the battery dry after an hour or so while trying different combinations of focusing , ISO settings etc. so I didnt take photos of the moon and other planets I wanted tonight.</p>
<p>The weather also didnt help since there are some scattered clouds that pass and spoil the fun <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">  ..</p>
<p>I managed to capture a good still of Saturn and I am looking forward to Saturday when the so called “super moon” will be visible ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MPmdJ6mGQ4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MPmdJ6mGQ4</a> ) </p>
