<p>Just came back from <a href="http://serres.fosscomm.gr/">fosscomm 2012</a> xD<br>
Interesting topics , great people and lots of fun..<br>
Our group <a href="http://foss.aueb.gr/">fossaueb</a> was especially adventurous with lots of happy accidents like some of the dudes missing the train stop at Serres , walking in circles trying to find the conference and other things..</p>
<p>Noteable sessions were the ones made by Dimitris Andreadis , one of the team leaders of the JBoss project , the Greek Pirate party speeches and Creative Commons topics , the Unix-like kernel programming from scratch by Giannis Tsiompikas and the workshops including RPM packaging step by step by Nikos Roussos aka <a href="https://github.com/comzeradd">comzeradd</a></p>
<p>I also took a lot of photos some of which are <a href="http://foss.aueb.gr/files/Fosscomm_FossAUEB.tar.gz">in this photo album tarball <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley"> </a></p>
