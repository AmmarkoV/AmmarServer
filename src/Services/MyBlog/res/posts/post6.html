<a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/AmmarServer">AmmarServer</a> is now pretty stable and I am begining to add more interesting functionallity such as request caching etc..</p>
<p>One of the tests that Iâ€™ve made is converting this wordpress site into static files using <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/scrapbook/">a firefox extension called scrapbook that can save entire web sites many pages deep as files</a> and then using the saved files , serving them with ammarserver <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley">   !</p>
<p>The result is that AmmarServer serving the cached files ( reading them from the disk every time ) is actually serving them twice as fast as when apache + php + wordpress dynamically create most of the content and serve the images etc in the same manner.. I am wondering how much better will I be able to do by caching and not querying the filesystem / hard disk subsystem at all..!   </p>
<p>Attached are two screenshots taken using the <a href="http://www.numion.com/stopwatch/">numion stopwatch</a> tool</p>
<p>AmmarServer running on port 8080 ,serving cached files reading them from disk and scoring 0.838 seconds<br>

<p>Regular apache + php + wordpress running on the site you currently see and scoring 1.888 seconds almost the double time..</p><center><br>

<p>These tests were executed on the same machine in a LAN network so no serious network unpredictable latencies exist and we are almost purely CPU bound..</p>
<p>Testing with caching in memory enabled for my site today gives the following times..<br>
Apache + PHP + MySQL + WordPress : 2.323 secs<br>
AmmarServer , cache enabled , first hit serving everything as a file : 1.383<br>
AmmarServer , cache enabled , subsequent hits serving everything from memory : 0.762<br>

<p>using :<br>
time wget http://ammar.gr/<br>
and<br>
time wget http://ammar.gr:8080/<br>
just for the index.php  file of wordpress shows the difference , 0.2s vs 0.004s </p>
