<p>Well , things aren`t going very well in Greece..<br>
Stocks are falling , strikes and riots everyday and a general anxiety and disappointment about where this country is heading. Although I can`t say I belong to a social class directly pressured (yet) by the economic meltdown happening all around ( and if I did I would probably not blog about it ) it is sad to see the pessimism diffused everywhere and especially in everyone aged 23-28 , a generation that has just now reached the point to enter the working force after finishing with the educational cycle of life.<br>
Even if there is unemployment and even if we are the 600euro generation ( a term coined up by Greek media , as it is the average post-reductions monthly wage for most junior positions at Greek companies ) I cant stop but think that I am lucky to be part of it.<br>
People have always had problems and always were tormented , in the past , in the present and will probably continue to do so in the future. But it just isn`t possible for past “primitive” societies to be able to produce men like Plato , Fermat , DaVinci , Kant, Nietzsche and at this day and age with all the wonderful possibilities opened with tools such as the internet to see the public acting so foolishly panicked and such a lack of leadership from the Greek financial and political leaders.<br>
It is this attitude that produces the biggest part of the crisis as members of the Greek community dont trust each other , and don`t even trust themselves.<br>
And its a natural consequence that when people fail to stand up to a crisis as units they will also fail as a group.    </p>
<p>This is my first real post , apart for blogs about technical details of work I’ve done and I don`t want to babble a lot.</p>
<p>In a few words I wish that people would realize the possibilities laid before them and grab life by the throat instead of passively whine about it and blame everyone else.  </p>
<p>I guess it is a gift most people lack, to be able to see possibility where most people don`t..</p>
