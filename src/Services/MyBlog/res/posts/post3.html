<p>Army service is done , and I am slowly picking up my life from where I left it 9 months ago..</p>
<p>One of the things I would like to do is improve this site and make it a little more user friendly and intuitive for the passing internet-traveler <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  that stumbles upon it..</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been playing with the theme for a couple of days , but things will remain fluid until I reach a nice result! </p>
