<p>In the past weeks I started to take timelapse photographs using my Nikon D-7000 camera and ffmpeg and image magick video and picture converters..!</p>
<p>My camera has a built in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervalometer">intervalometer</a> that I use to acquire the pictures , but lower-end cameras that do not have this kind of functionality <a href="http://openmoco.org/node/88">can be “hacked” with an Arduino i.e.</a> and be used likewise.  <a href="http://openmoco.org/">This site</a> has a lot of opensource hardware and software , that can be used to this end.</p>
<p>The results are not so good until now <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley">  , at least when compared to this..<br>

<p>Due to environmental pollution and the lights of the city there are only a few stars visible from Athens. For daytime shots on the other hand , I have yet to find a proper position and camera configuration that on a course of 5-10 hours for example will provide a pleasing visual result..! </p>
<p>These are some of my timelapses so far , the third is the best one..<br>

<p><a href="user/uploads/2011/12/TimeLapseTools.tar.gz">These are the scripts I use.. (TimeLapseTools.tar)</a></p>
<p>And these are the instructions : </p>
<p>To customize them you should edit the files directly and append your own parameters  </p>
<p>STEP 0 : You will first need to extract the TimeLapseTools.tar.gz somewhere and empty your photographs , to become timelapsed in the FOLDER folder <img src="wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley"><br>
they will have filenames like DSC_XXXX.jpg</p>
<p>STEP 1 : Make sure you have ffmpeg and imagemagick installed on your Linux Distro , for Debian/Ubuntu you can do sudo apt-get install ffmpeg imagemagick to download them.<br>
It goes without saying that if you need an exotic codec for your video file you must also find it and download it too..</p>
<p>STEP 2 : Open a terminal and cd to the directory which has the scripts</p>
<p>STEP 3 : Run ./file_rename_script.sh which will change the filenames from DSC_XXXX.jpg to img_XXX.jpg starting from img_001.jpg and empty the FOLDER directory placing all of the files in the current dir.</p>
<p>STEP 4 : Run ./resize_images.sh which will change the resolution of the images to 1631×1080 for my cameras aspect ration creating _img_XXX.jpg for every img_XXX.jpg ( notice the initial _ )</p>
<p>STEP 5 : Run ./ffmpegcommand which will create an mp4 file with an image size of 1631×1080 @ 25 fps </p>
<p>STEP 6 : Upload to Youtube , or profit ;p </p>
