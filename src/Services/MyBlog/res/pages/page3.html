<p>GuarddoG is my robotics pet project , a robotics platform with a goal to see , hear , navigate the world and help guard homes and offices..</p>
<p>It is actually my biggest project , I am still actively developing it , and due to its size I have a stand-alone blog dedicated to it.</p>
<p>You can <a href="gddg.html" target="_blank">click here to enter the GuarddoG blog</a><br>
The source code of the software is availiable in the <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/" target="_blank">RoboVision Github repository</a><br>
You can also <a href="https://github.com/AmmarkoV/RoboVision/tarball/master" target="_blank">directly download it ( for the impatient ) using this link</a></p>
